### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Ph.D. student in the <a href="https://cidse.engineering.asu.edu/" target="_blank">School of Computing, Informatics, and Decision Systems Engineering</a> at <a href="https://www.asu.edu/" target="_blank">Arizona State University</a>, advised by <a href="http://siddharthsrivastava.net/" target="_blank">Dr. Siddharth Srivastava</a>. I have completed M.Tech. from <a href="http://www.iitg.ac.in/cse/" target="_blank">Department of Computer Science &amp; Engineering</a> at <a href="http://www.iitg.ac.in/" target="_blank">IIT Guwahati</a>, advised by <a href="http://www.iitg.ernet.in/pkdas/" target="_blank">Dr. Pradip K. Das</a>.

My primary interests lies in AI planning, model learning, and analysis of abstractions. In the past I have worked in the area of bio-inspired robotics, speech processing and internet of things.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on interrogation of autonomous agents where based on agentâ€™s responses, we can reason about its internal model.
