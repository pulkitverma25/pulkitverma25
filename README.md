### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Ph.D. student in the <a href="https://cidse.engineering.asu.edu/" target="_blank">School of Computing, Informatics, and Decision Systems Engineering</a> at <a href="https://www.asu.edu/" target="_blank">Arizona State University</a>, advised by <a href="http://siddharthsrivastava.net/" target="_blank">Prof. Siddharth Srivastava</a>. I am also affiliated with UC Berkeley's <a href="https://humancompatible.ai/" target="_blank">Center for Human-Compatible Artificial Intelligence</a>. I have completed M.Tech. from <a href="http://www.iitg.ac.in/cse/" target="_blank">Department of Computer Science &amp; Engineering</a> at <a href="http://www.iitg.ac.in/" target="_blank">IIT Guwahati</a>, advised by <a href="http://www.iitg.ernet.in/pkdas/" target="_blank">Prof. Pradip K. Das</a>.

My primary interests lie in AI safety, AI planning, action-model learning, and analysis of abstractions. In the past I have worked in the area of bio-inspired robotics, speech processing and internet of things.

ðŸ”­ My research focuses on safe and reliable behavior of AI agents. I am currently investigating the minimal set of interfaces in an AI system that would enable a user to assess and understand the limits of its safe operability.
