### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Postdoctoral Associate in the <a href="https://interactive.mit.edu/" target="_blank">Interactive Robotics Group</a> at <a href="https://www.csail.mit.edu/" target="_blank">CSAIL</a> and <a href="https://aeroastro.mit.edu/" target="_blank">AeroAstro</a>, <a href="https://web.mit.edu/" target="_blank">MIT</a>, working with <a href="https://interactive.mit.edu/about/people/julie" target="_blank">Prof. Julie Shah</a>. I completed my Ph.D. from the <a href="https://scai.engineering.asu.edu/" target="_blank">School of Computing and Augmented Intelligence</a> at <a href="https://www.asu.edu/" target="_blank">Arizona State University</a>, working with <a href="http://siddharthsrivastava.net" target="_blank">Prof. Siddharth Srivastava</a>. During my Ph.D., I was also affiliated with UC Berkeley's <a href="https://humancompatible.ai/" target="_blank">Center for Human-Compatible Artificial Intelligence</a>, and ASU's <a href="https://globalsecurity.asu.edu/human-artificial-intelligence-and-robot-teaming" target="_blank">Center for Human, Artificial Intelligence, and Robot Teaming</a>. I have completed M.Tech. from <a href="http://www.iitg.ac.in/cse/" target="_blank">Department of Computer Science &amp; Engineering</a> at <a href="http://www.iitg.ac.in/" target="_blank">IIT Guwahati</a>, advised by <a href="http://www.iitg.ernet.in/pkdas/" target="_blank">Prof. Pradip K. Das</a>.

My primary interests lie in AI safety, AI planning, action-model learning, and analysis of abstractions. My research focuses on safe and reliable behavior of AI agents. I am currently investigating the minimal set of requirements in an AI system that would enable a user to assess and understand the limits of its safe operability.
